# capitol_posts

The study examines collective psychological empowerment among Capitol rioters. Existing publicly available datasets of scraped Parler data is used for this. Data has been reduced to the day of interest (Jan 6, 2021), and cross-checked with meta data, when available. Two secondary datasets are used for the analysis, which can be found here: 1. https://github.com/sbooeshaghi/parlertrick/tree/main/data (see also: https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Parler; https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11574/10077), 2. https://zenodo.org/record/4442460#.YEdRAJ37SMp
