# capitol_posts

For a study investigating collective psychological empowerment among Capitol rioters, I reviewed existing publicly available datasets of scraped Parler data. Data has been filtered to only show the day of the attack (Jan 6, 2021), and cross-checked with meta data, where available (Aliapoulios et al., 2021). Two secondary datasets were used for this review, which can be found here: 1. https://github.com/sbooeshaghi/parlertrick/tree/main/data (see also: https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Parler; https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11574/10077), 2. https://zenodo.org/record/4442460#.YEdRAJ37SMp
