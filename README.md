For a study investigating collective psychological empowerment among Capitol rioters, I reviewed Parler data from two prepared datasets which had derived from publicly available scraped data. They can be found here: 1. https://github.com/sbooeshaghi/parlertrick/tree/main/data (see also: https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Parler; https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11574/10077), 2. https://zenodo.org/record/4442460#.YEdRAJ37SMp
I created a new dataset out of the two, which has been filtered to only show the day of the attack (Jan 6, 2021), and which was partially cross-checked for bots with meta data, where available (cf. Aliapoulios et al., 2021).
